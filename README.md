- 👋 Hi, I’m @raquelpinheiro
- ✨ I have working as backend developer but I am getting acknowledgement in recent frameworks to do things on frontend too. I have skills on NoSql, Azure Cloud, CI/CD, Kubernetes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NodeJs
- 🌱 I have much more skills with backend development but I'm studying to have more experience with SPA and CSS. I think this is necessary.
- 💞️ I strongly support women and all other diversity groups to learn and be in software development
